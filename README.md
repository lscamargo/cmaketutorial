# cmaketutorial
My personal implementation of the [CMake official tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html)

My environment has the VS 2019 Community with Windows 10 SDK 10.19

To compile a step you have to be on the folder *build* and run:
```
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
